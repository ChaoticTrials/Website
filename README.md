# Chaotic Trials Website

## Docusaurus

### Current State

This page is currently under development. For wiki pages of my mods, please
visit [Chaotic Trials Wiki](https://wiki.chaotictrials.de/). You can find the current deployment of the website
at [Chaotic Trials Staging](https://staging.chaotictrials.de/).

### Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   This runs the Docusaurus development server. You can view the site at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Edit wiki entries in `docs/mods/`. Always make sure to add the information for the correct version.
