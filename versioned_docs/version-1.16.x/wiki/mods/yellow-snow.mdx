# Yellow Snow

import ProjectHeader from '@site/src/components/ProjectHeader';

<ProjectHeader slug="yellow-snow" mcVersion="1.16" />

The most epic mod made for [WinterJam 2020](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/mmds-winterjam-2020), which
adds peed snow.

---

## Peed Snow Spread
This snow can spread onto normal snow (configurable) at the same speed as grass. The time required to stand on a snow
block to turn it into yellow snow is 5 seconds, and this duration can be adjusted in the config. By default, players
cannot pee on snow (configurable), but all monsters and animals can.

## Snowball Damage
Throwing a snowball will cause damage on impact. The damage ranges from 0.5 to 1 heart, with an additional 2 hearts of
damage specifically for blazes.

## Compatibility
This mod is compatible with [Naughty or Nice](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/naughty-or-nice). Placing a
snow block (layer) will decrease niceness by 0.01 points, while breaking it will increase niceness by 0.005 points.
