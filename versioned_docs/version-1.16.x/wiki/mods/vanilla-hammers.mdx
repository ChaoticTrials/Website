## Special Features
Hammers can mine in a 3x3 area and are effective on the same blocks as pickaxes. While sneaking, they only break the
targeted block.

## Obsidian Hammer
The **Obsidian Hammer** excels at breaking Obsidian blocks more efficiently. If you frequently need to mine Obsidian,
using Obsidian tools is highly recommended.
