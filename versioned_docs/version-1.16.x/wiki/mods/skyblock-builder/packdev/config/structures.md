# Structures
## Generating Structures
This section provides a list of all [structures](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Generated_structures) that should be
generated. The complete list of possible structures can be found in `config/skyblockbuilder/structures.txt`. Some
structures in the Nether are generated by default, but you can disable this if desired. In the Overworld, the stronghold
is the only structure generated by default.

This is a resource list. Read more about
it [here](https://moddingx.org/libx/org/moddingx/libx/util/data/ResourceList.html#use_resource_lists_in_configs).

## Generating Features
This section provides a list of all [features](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Configured_feature) that should be
generated. The complete list of possible features can be found in `config/skyblockbuilder/features.txt`. As
described in the Minecraft Wiki, features require specific conditions to generate properly, which can be achieved using
the surface.

:::note
The two default values are required for generating the obsidian towers in the End. If these values are
missing, the towers will only be generated when the dragon respawns.
