# Join Requests
## Sending a Join Request
If you are not currently in a team, you can send a join request to any team using the command `/skyblock join <team>`.
This will send a request to the team, and each member of the team has the option to accept or deny your request.

## Accepting Requests
Team members can accept a join request from a player by using the command `/skyblock team accept <player>`. This action
will teleport the player to your island. To deny the request, use the command `/skyblock team deny <player>`.

## Disabling Requests
You can check your team's current join request status with the command `/skyblock team allowRequests`. To enable or
disable join requests, use the command `/skyblock team allowRequests <true/false>`.
