# Visiting
## Visiting Other Islands
If visits are enabled in the configuration and a team has enabled visiting, you can visit an island using the command
`/skyblock visit <team>`.

## Enabling Visiting
To check the current visiting state of your team, use the command `/skyblock team allowVisits`. You can enable or
disable visiting with `/skyblock team allowVisits <true/false>`. By default, new teams have this setting set to `false`.
