# Skyblock
![Starting template](/img/projects/skyblock-builder/examples/skyblock/start_template.png)

This is the default island provided by the mod. There's no need to adjust any configuration for this setupâ€”just use it
as it is.

If you'd like a different starting island, simply replace the `config/skyblockbuilder/default.nbt` file and adjust
the [spawns](../packdev/packdev.md#possible-spawns) accordingly.

_The following examples will include downloads with all the relevant changes._
