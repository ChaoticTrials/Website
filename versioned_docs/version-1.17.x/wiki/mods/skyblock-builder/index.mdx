## Examples and Downloads

There are examples provided for each version, which include downloads that can be used as references. You may use them
to view the config files and see the changes in-game. Note that the configs in the downloads **only** contain changes,
and default values are not included in the downloads.

## Want to Help Improve the Mod?

The easiest way to contribute is to report bugs and suggestions
on [GitHub](https://github.com/ChaoticTrials/SkyblockBuilder).

Another way to contribute is by translating the mod! You can use GitHub for this, which is easiest for me and you'll be
marked as a contributor on GitHub. Alternatively, you can
use [OneSky](https://oss5m9q.oneskyapp.com/admin/project/dashboard/project/177200). I will download the file once the
language is more than 90% translated.
