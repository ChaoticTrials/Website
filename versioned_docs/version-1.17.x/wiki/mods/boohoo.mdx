This mod was made for [SpookyJam 2021](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/spookyjam-2021-forge-edition).

## Ghost Features

- It contains a ghost which could spawn at night.
- The chance for being summoned is configurable.
- Default chance is **0.1%** each tick that a ghost spawns next to you.

## Health Mechanics

- The health increases by attacking other players and entities. It decreases when the player gets damage.
- The health can also be configured by a multiplier in the config.

## Player and Ghost Interaction

- Each player can only have one ghost each night.
- If the ghost kills you, it will stay in the world and fly around a bit, without targeting other players.
- The ghost disappears after (default) 60 seconds.
- It will steal a random item from you when it kills you (configurable). This item will be dropped when the ghost disappears or dies.

## Ghost Drops

- The ghost drops 1 to 2 enchanted books with a random enchantment.
- For each book, there is a 5% chance that the enchantment level is the highest possible level for this enchantment.
- There is a 50% chance that the level is max level + 1 if you get this book.

## Configurable Settings

- The ghost disappears at day (configurable).
- If you want to disable the ghost in any dimension, there's a list in the config for that.
