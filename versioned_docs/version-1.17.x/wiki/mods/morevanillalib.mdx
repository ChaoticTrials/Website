## Abilities
### Auto Smelt
Tools with Auto Smelt modify drops by replacing them with their furnace-processed output. This applies to block drops
(e.g., Log -> Charcoal) and mob drops (e.g., Raw Beef -> Steak).

This ability can be turned off in [features config](#features).

### Double Drop
The Double Drop feature allows specific ores to drop additional items when mined, depending on the tool's material. The
chance for extra drops is configurable, and tools without the Silk Touch enchantment can trigger this feature. Diamond,
Coal, Emerald, Lapis, Quartz, and Redstone ores have unique chances for Double Drops based on their respective
configuration settings, see [materials](#materials) above.

This ability can be turned off in [features config](#features).

### Extra Damage
Extra Damage is applied to specific entities when using axes and swords based on the tool type:

| **Tool Type**  | **Affected Entities**         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Bone**       | Skeletons                     |
| **Ender**      | Endermen and Endermites       |
| **Fiery**      | Magma Cubes                   |
| **Prismarine** | Guardians                     |
| **Slime**      | Slimes, excluding Magma Cubes |

:::info
This effect applies to direct subclasses of the mentioned entities. If a mod uses the vanilla base class of these
entities, they will also be affected.
:::

The default chance is 20% per hit, configurable in the [features config](#features).

### Extra Drop
Tools have a material-based chance to drop their repair material on each use (e.g., hitting a mob or mining a block).

The default chance is 0.05% per use, configurable in the [features config](#features).

### Glowstone Drop
Glowstone blocks will always drop 4 Glowstone Dust.

### Head Drop
Defeating skeleton-type enemies may result in a rare drop of the enemy's head. This chance is influenced by the Fortune
enchantment on the tool.

The default chance is 5% per kill, configurable in the [features config](#features).

### Knockback
The attacked mob will be hit with vanilla knockback. Additionally, Knockback enchantment can't be applied to these
tools.

### Paper Damage
Using Paper tools introduces a chance for the player to inflict minor self-damage, humorously called a "paper cut". This
can occur during tasks such as using items, destroying blocks, or hitting entities.

The default chance is 10% per activity, configurable in the [features config](#features).

## Enchantments
### Luck of Cheap Repairing
**Luck of Cheap Repairing** is an enchantment that removes the repair cost in an anvil. This enchantment can be applied
to all breakable items.

### Power of the Depth
**Power of the Depth** increases the mining depth of [hammers](vanilla-hammers.mdx)
and [excavators](vanilla-excavators.mdx), one level for each enchantment level.
Enchantments can be disabled in the [features config](#features).

Enchantments can be disabled in [features config](#features).

## Config
### Tool Values
You can customize nearly everything about the tools. For each tool type, you can adjust:
- Durability
- Speed
- Attack Damage Bonus
- Attack Speed
- Harvest Level
- Enchantment Value

This config is divided into three main categories:
- AIOTs: Unused in 1.17
- Normal Tools: Used for [MoreVanillaTools](morevanillatools.mdx)
- Ranged Tools: Used for [Vanilla Hammers](vanilla-hammers.mdx) and [Vanilla Excavators](vanilla-excavators.mdx)

### Features
In the features config, you can adjust the abilities of the [materials](#materials), or disable non-vanilla materials (
used for [Vanilla Hammers](vanilla-hammers.mdx) and [Vanilla Excavators](vanilla-excavators.mdx) only).

## Tooltips
When pressing Shift while hovering over an item, it will reveal more details about durability, harvest level, and repair
items.
