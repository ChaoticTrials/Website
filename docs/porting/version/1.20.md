## Mods with an unclear future

These mods might not be ported at all. If  they are ported then probably roughly in this order:

- ByeStack ‚≠ï
- [Default World Type](https://modrinth.com/mod/defaultworldtype) ‚úî
- [More XFood](https://modrinth.com/mod/morexfood) ‚≠ï
- [MoreVanillaArmor](https://modrinth.com/mod/morevanillaarmor) ‚úî

## Mods that won't be ported

These mods are not being ported to 1.20. At least not by me. Don't ask for them. If you really want them, learn modding
and do it yourself.

- Nothing at the moment, lucky you :)
