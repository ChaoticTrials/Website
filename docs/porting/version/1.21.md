description: Porting progress to 1.21

## Forge vs. NeoForge

Starting with version 1.21, I will no longer support [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/) for 1.21 and higher. My
focus will instead shift to [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net/). There are no plans to release a Forge version in the
future, nor is there an intention to release a Fabric version anytime soon.

## Mods with an unclear future

These mods might not be ported at all. If they are ported then probably roughly in this order:

- [MoreVanillaArmor](https://modrinth.com/mod/morevanillaarmor) ‚≠ï
- [Recipe Printer](https://modrinth.com/mod/recipe-printer) ‚≠ï

## Mods that won't be ported

These mods are not being ported to 1.21. At least not by me. Don't ask for them. If you really want them, learn modding
and do it yourself.
