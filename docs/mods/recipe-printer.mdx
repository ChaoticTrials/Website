This mod is for client use only and is not intended for modpacks. Do not attempt to join a server with this mod
installed. It is primarily designed for content creators who want to showcase recipes or creative tabs.

## Recipe Printing
This feature allows you to print recipes as PNG images. To do this, use the following command:
- `/recipeprinter recipe morevanillatools:emerald_pickaxe`

![Example Recipe](/img/projects/recipe-printer/example_recipe.png)

:::tip
If [JEI](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei) is present, you can use this command instead:
- `/recipeprinter fromJei morevanillatools:emerald_pickaxe`
  
This allows you to use recipe types that are not implemented by the mod itself but are integrated with JEI.
:::

To create all recipes by `morevanillatools`, you can use the following command:
- `/recipeprinter recipe morevanillatools:*`

## Creative Tabs
You can also print creative tabs. To do this, use the following command:
- `/recipeprinter itemgroup minecraft:tools`
