The contents of the mod can be divided into three main
categories: [Crafting Ingredients](#crafting-ingredients), [Block Storage](#block-storage),
and [Disk Storage](#disk-storage).

## Disk Storage
The primary storage solution, and the best known, is the disk. It functions similarly to Refined Storage but with larger
storage capacities.

## Block Storage
The secondary storage solution. It can be used like a regular block and doesn't require a drive. It is similar to
Refined Storage but with larger storage capacities. As in Refined Storage, you can adjust the power consumption in the
mod's server configuration within the world directory.

## Crafting Ingredients
There are a few additional crafting ingredients because, with great power, comes great responsibility.
