# Blocks

## Experience Crystal
The **Experience Crystal** is a block that lets players store and retrieve experience levels. This is particularly
useful for saving XP for future use or transferring experience between players. The crystal attracts XP orbs within a
7-block radius and collects them in its internal storage.

## Crude Furnace
The **Crude Furnace** offers a faster smelting alternative to the standard Furnace, working at twice the speed but
yielding only half the experience. It can only process items that cannot be smelted by Smokers or Blast Furnaces.

## Advanced Brewery
The **Advanced Brewery** is an enhanced brewing mechanism for creating, modifying, and upgrading potions in Minecraft.

### How It Works
- **Fuel Mechanism**: Uses `Blaze Powder` as fuel, placed in a designated slot. Each unit fuels the brewery for 20
  operations.
- **Brewing Time**: Takes up to 400 ticks/20 seconds, with special particle effects during the process.

  - **Slots and Ingredients**:
      - **Ingredient Slot (0)**: Place the primary ingredient required for brewing here.
      - **Potion Ingredient Slots (1 and 2)**: Place existing potions to transform or upgrade them.
      - **Output Slot (3)**: The finished potion appears here after brewing.
      - **Blaze Slot (4)**: Place `Blaze Powder` here to fuel the process.

- **Item Handlers Interaction**:
    - **Top**: Main ingredient and output interaction.
    - **Sides**: Potion ingredients and fuel insertion.
    - **Bottom**: Empty or remove potion ingredient slots.

- **Potion Output**: Depending on the recipe, the brewery yields different potions, placed back into the designated
  slots.

### Modes of Operation
- **Brewing**: Functions like a regular brewery. Place a potion in the center slot and a special ingredient in the input
  slot. View brewing recipes in [JEI](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei).
- **Merging**: Combines effects of two potions in the outer slots (1 and 2) into a new potion. The center slot must
  contain a Glass Bottle, and the ingredient slot (0) should be empty. Complex potions may result in
  a [Failed Potion](items.mdx#failed-potion).
- **Upgrading**: Enhances potions with a single effect, increasing the amplifier up to III. Place the potion to be
  upgraded in the center slot and a Popped Chorus Fruit in the ingredient slot (0).
- **Cloning**: Duplicates a potion. Place the potion to be cloned in the center slot and two Water Bottles in the outer
  slots. Put Netherite Scrap in the ingredient slot to clone the potion.

## Weak Redstone Torch
The **Weak Redstone Torch** functions similarly to a regular redstone torch but does not strongly power the block above
it. This is useful for providing a redstone signal without affecting adjacent blocks.

## Comparator Redirector
The **Comparator Redirector** redirects comparator readings from blocks above or below it, making it useful for reading
the state of containers like chests from below.

## Linked Repeater
The **Linked Repeater** is a wireless redstone repeater that uses [Linked Crystals](items.mdx#linked-redstone-crystal)
to transmit redstone signals over distances without needing wires.

## Rails
### Highspeed Rail
The **Highspeed Rail** provides a faster alternative to the Powered Rail but cannot be used on slopes. It is ideal for
creating high-speed minecart tracks on flat surfaces.

### Directional Rail
The **Directional Rail** moves minecarts in a single direction without external power sources, useful for automated
pathways with specific directional flows.

### Filter Rail
The **Filter Rail** sorts minecarts based on their label, set with a [Minecart Tinkerer](items.mdx#minecart-tinkerer).
Labeled minecarts go sideways, while others continue straight.

### Reinforced Rail
The **Reinforced Rail** maintains high speed on turns, similar to [Highspeed Rails](#highspeed-rail), but cannot be used
on slopes.

### Piston Minecart Controller Rail
The **Piston Minecart Controller Rail** manages [Piston Minecarts](misc.mdx#piston-minecart). Labels set with
a [Minecart Tinkerer](items.mdx#minecart-tinkerer) configure the mode for Piston Minecarts traveling over it. These
rails are not replaced by Piston Minecarts.
