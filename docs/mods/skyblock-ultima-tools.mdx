## Config
In the config, you can change the ores for the **Ultima-Fighter** in `ores.overworld`. The order is important!
`ores.nether` is not used. That's something I just realized while writing this.

`animals.animals` defines the animals that are spawned by **Blood-Magician** when used on land, and
`animals.water_animals` defines the animals spawned when used in water.

All the other config values are the cooldown durations in ticks for each tool.
