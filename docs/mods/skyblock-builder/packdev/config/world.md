# World
## Biome range
The radius for the biomes to repeat. An area with the size of (by default) 8192x8192 will contain all the biomes in the
world. If a biome isn't in this area, it's not in the world. It repeats after an invisible "border".

This feature can be disabled and the biomes will not repeat.

**WARNING**: Too small biome range will prevent some structures to generate, if structures are enabled, because some need
a special biome! You may fix this by decreasing the [structure modifier](#structure-modifier).

## Island distance
The distance between two islands. If you choose `the_nether` as [start dimension](spawn.md#dimension), it will be 
divided by 8.

## Offset
The offset from 0, 0 to generate the islands. Can be used to generate them in the middle of .mca files.

## Sea height
The sea level in the world. This has nothing to do with the water height in the world. This does affect the spawn height
of squids for example.

## Structure modifier
The modifier for spacing and separation of structures. These values can be defined by a data pack. However, this is a
multiplier to change these values. Look [here ðŸ”—](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Custom#Generator_types) at 
`biome_source.structures.structures` for more information about that.

Minimal spacing will be set to 1 if the modifier changes it to be lower than that.
Minimal separation will be set to 0 if the modifier changes it to be lower than that.

**This config option needs a full restart once you already joined a world.**

## Surface
The block settings for generating the overworld surface. It's in the same format as 
[flat world generation settings ðŸ”—](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Superflat#Preset_code_format), but will ignore
the biome. You can set it for the overworld only. If the surface is disabled, it will ignore the setting.

## Single biome
### Biome
Specifies the biome for a whole dimension. You can set the dimension you want. If you keep it as `default`, the 
[start dimension](spawn.md#dimension) will be used.

Allowed values:

- `default`
- `overworld`
- `the_nether`
- `the_end`

**WARNING**: Some structures need a special biome, e.g. Mansion needs Dark Oak Forest! These structures will not be generated if you have only one biome!
