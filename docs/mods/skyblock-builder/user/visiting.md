# Visiting
## Visiting other islands
If visits are enabled in the config, and a team enabled visiting, you can visit an island with `/skyblock visit <team>`.

## Enable visiting
You can see your teams current visiting state with `/skyblock team allowVisits` and enable/disable it with 
`/skyblock team allowVisits <true/false>`. On new teams, this is set to `false`.
