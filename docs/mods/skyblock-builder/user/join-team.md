# Join requests
## Sending a join request
You can send a join request to all teams if you're currently in no team by using `/skyblock join <team>`. That will 
send a request to the team and each player in the team can accept or deny your request.

## Accepting requests
Each user of a team can use `/skyblock team accept <player>` to accept the given player. That will teleport the player 
to your island. You can also deny the request by using `/skyblock team deny <player>`.

## Disable requests
You can see your teams current join request state with `/skyblock team allowRequests` and enable/disable it with 
`/skyblock team allowRequests <true/false>`.
