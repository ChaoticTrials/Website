## Set Bonus
A set bonus applies to the player only when they are wearing all parts of a specific armor set unless specified
otherwise, like [Heavyness](#heavyness), which is dynamic for each part.

### Damage Reduction
:::note
This has nothing to do with the 4 numbers in the "Damage Reduction" column of the table above.
:::
The "Damage Reduction" effect helps reduce damage from various sources, except falling. For example, a level 1 effect
reduces damage by 2 points. However, players will always take at least 0.25 damage to maintain game balance.

### Fire Immunity
Grants immunity to fire. When burning, the player does not receive any damage.

### Heavyness
The "Heavyness" effect increases fall damage. For instance, a level 1 effect increases fall damage by 50%, level 2
doubles it (100%), and level 3 increases it by 150%.

The level is dynamic:

| Armor Part | Additional Level(s) |
|------------|---------------------|
| Helmet     | 1                   |
| Chest      | 3                   |
| Leggings   | 2                   |
| Boots      | 1                   |

This makes for a total of 7 levels, increasing fall damage by 350%. Luckily, Obsidian also has
the [Damage Reduction](#damage-reduction) set bonus.

### Power Source
Activates redstone contraptions when the player walks. This only works when there is some air around the contraption (
for placing an invisible block that activates redstone).

## Durability Factor
- Durability factor multipliers:
    - 11 for Head
    - 16 for Chestplate
    - 15 for Leggings
    - 13 for Boots
