# Yellow Snow

import ProjectHeader from '@site/src/components/ProjectHeader';

<ProjectHeader slug="yellow-snow" mcVersion="1.16" />

The most epic mod made for [WinterJam 2020](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/mmds-winterjam-2020). It adds
peed snow.

## Peed Snow Spread

This snow can spread onto normal snow (configurable) with the same speed of grass spreading. The duration you need to
stand on a snow block to turn it into yellow snow is 5 seconds and can be changed in config. Players are not able to pee
on snow by default (configurable), but all monsters and animals can.

## Snowball Damage

Throwing a snowball will hurt on impact. The damage is 0.5 to 1 heart, with an additional 2 hearts for blazes.

## Compatibility

This mod is also compatible with [Naughty or Nice](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/naughty-or-nice).
Placing a snow block (layer) will remove 0.01 niceness, while breaking it will add 0.005 points.
