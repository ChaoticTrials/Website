# Curse of Curses

import ProjectHeader from '@site/src/components/ProjectHeader';

<ProjectHeader slug="curse-of-curses" mcVersion="1.16" />

**Curse of Curses** introduces a new layer of challenge and unpredictability to your gameplay. Every night, the mod
randomly curses an item in your inventory, adding excitement and danger. You can adjust the chance of curses via the
config file.

---

## Configuration
You can customize various aspects of how curses are applied in the config file. This includes setting the times when
curses might be applied, their probabilities, and other related features.

## Danger Times
Define the number of "danger times" during a Minecraft day when curses can be applied. By default, there are 3 danger
times between ticks 18000 and 21000. During these ticks, each player has a chance to receive curses based on the
configured probability. The default chance is 1% for each item, with curses potentially affecting multiple items unless
configured otherwise.

## Cursed Items
The mod can apply curses to both normal and already cursed items. If no matching curse is available for a particular
item, it will not receive an additional curse.

## Cursed Sleep
To add further challenge, Curse of Curses can apply curses while the player is sleeping. This feature is enabled by
default. If you wish to only curse players who sleep multiple times, you can configure a row count to apply curses after
a specific number of sleeps.

## Blacklisted Curses
If there are certain curses you do not want applied by this mod, you can use the `blacklistedCurses` option in the
config file. Add the curses you wish to ignore to the deny list. For example:
- `"minecraft:*"` -> Ignores all curses added by Minecraft
- `"minecraft:binding_curse"` -> Ignores the Curse of Binding
