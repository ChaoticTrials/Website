### Mana Battery
The **Mana Battery** is a mana storage block. It has two slots: the left slot (➖) is for placing a mana-consuming item
(e.g., Mana/Elementium gear) to repair it or a Mana Tablet to fill it with mana from the battery. To fill the **Mana
Battery**, insert an item into the right slot (➕). If locked (see lock button), no items can be inserted or extracted.
Items can also be added/removed using hoppers or pipes, with mana automatically drained or inserted into the item. Once
completely filled or drained, the item can be extracted via hopper or pipe.

A **creative** variant of the battery has unlimited transfer speed and constantly stores 5,000,000 mana. Mana can be
transferred to other machines (from Botania or Botanical Machinery) using Sparks or Mana Spreaders. Placing a Botanical
Machinery machine next to it will also transfer mana.
