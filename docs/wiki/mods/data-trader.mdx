# Data Trader

import ProjectHeader from '@site/src/components/ProjectHeader';

<ProjectHeader slug="data-trader" mcVersion="1.18" />

## Defining Trades
### File Structure
The trader can use an ID to identify merchant offers' "recipes". This is a list of individual `merchant offer`s. An
example file might look like this:
```json title="data/modid/merchant_offers/example.json"
{
  "Recipes": [
    {
      "buy": {
        "item": "minecraft:diamond",
        "count": 3
      },
      "buyB": {
        "item": "minecraft:wooden_pickaxe"
      },
      "sell": {
        "item": "minecraft:diamond_pickaxe",
        "nbt": "{Damage:0,Enchantments:[{id:\"minecraft:efficiency\",lvl:2},{id:\"minecraft:unbreaking\",lvl:10}]}"
      },
      "uses": 10,
      "maxUses": 50,
      "rewardExp": false,
      "xp": 0,
      "priceMultiplier": 0.0,
      "specialPrice": 0,
      "demand": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

This example includes only one merchant offer. The trader will sell the item specified in `sell`. The player needs to
provide the items in `buy` and `buyB` to receive the sold item.

- **`maxUses`**: The number of times the trade can be used before the trader needs to restock.
- **`rewardExp`**: If true, the player will receive 3 to 6 XP points for each trade.
- **`xp`**: The amount of XP the trader receives. This is unused here since the trader doesn't level up.
- **`priceMultiplier`**: Used to calculate the price for the item count in `buy`.
- **`specialPrice`**: May increase or decrease the price.
- **`demand`**: Also influences the price for the item count in `buy`.

#### Required Values:
- `buy`
- `sell`

#### Default Values:
|       Name        | Default Value |
|:-----------------:|:-------------:|
|      `buyB`       |      Air      |
|      `uses`       |       0       |
|     `maxUses`     |       4       |
|    `rewardExp`    |     false     |
|       `xp`        |       0       |
| `priceMultiplier` |      0.0      |
|  `specialPrice`   |       0       |
|     `demand`      |       0       |

### Where to Put It
You need to use a data pack to provide these files. They should be placed at `<modid>/merchant_offers/`. An example can
be found 
[here](https://github.com/ChaoticTrials/DataTrader/tree/1.18.x/src/main/resources/data/datatrader/merchant_offers).

### How to Use
You can spawn the trader using the `/summon` command or by using a spawn egg. After spawning, you can set the recipe
with the command `/datatrader setOffer @e <modid>:<path>`. This can also be done through data packs. For a normal
trader, it is recommended to set `NoAI` to `true`.
