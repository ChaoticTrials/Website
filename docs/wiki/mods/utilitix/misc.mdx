# Miscellaneous

import ResponsiveIframe from '@site/src/components/ResponsiveIframe';

## Enchantments

### Bell Range
Increases the notification and glow range of the [Hand Bell](items.mdx#hand-bell) and [Mob Bell](items.mdx#mob-bell).

## Mechanics

### Better Mending
<div class="two-columns-base">
    <div class="two-columns-left">
        When an item with Mending is damaged and lies on the ground with nearby XP orbs, the item will attract the XP orbs. This occurs within a 7-block radius from the item's position. The collected XP is then used to repair the item.
        :::info
        This feature can be disabled in the configuration.

### Dynamic Creeper Explosions
When a Creeper explodes, the size of the explosion will now be adjusted based on the Creeper's current
health. A healthier Creeper will cause a larger explosion, while a Creeper with low health will result in a smaller
explosion. A Creeper with full health will cause as much damage as in vanilla.

### Controlled Shovel Flattening
This feature prevents players from flattening blocks using a shovel when the player is sneaking.

### Illusioner in Raid
The Illusioner will spawn in different raid waves during a raid as follows:

- **Wave 2:** 5 Illusioners
- **Wave 4:** 2 Illusioners
- **Wave 6:** 2 Illusioners
- **Wave 8:** 3 Illusioners

### Sneaking Prevents Waterlogging
While sneaking, waterloggable blocks will no longer get waterlogged. Instead, water will be placed as if waterlogging
does not exist.

## Double Door Opening
When two doors are placed next to each other with hinges in the center, both doors will open simultaneously.

## Auto Replant
When a seed item or sapling despawns, it will attempt to replant itself before discarding.

## Minecarts
### Ender Chest Minecart
A minecart equipped with built-in ender chest functionality.

### Stonecutter Minecart
The Stonecutter Minecart can break blocks. By right-clicking, you can adjust the position of the saw. It will always
break the block in front of the saw. The cart pauses while breaking a block and resumes its previous speed once done. It
won't break a block at the same position consecutively, preventing static block breaking. Block drops are placed on the
track, allowing collection with a hopper minecart.

### Anvil Minecart
The anvil minecart removes entities obstructing the track, pushing them off to allow other minecarts to pass safely. It
causes minimal damage (about a quarter of a heart) to entities during the push.

### Piston Minecart
<div class="two-columns-base">
    <div class="two-columns-left">
        This minecart can place and replace rails. It has an inventory where new rails can be placed on the left side and retrieved rails can be collected from the right side. Redstone torches can be added to power the rails; these torches are automatically placed below the track if the rails can be powered.
        The Piston Cart system has two primary modes: **Place** and **Replace**. Here's how each mode works:

#### Place Mode
- **Function**: The `Place` mode is used to lay down new rails where none currently exist.
- **Usage**:
    - The Piston Cart will automatically detect if there is no rail at its current position and attempt to place a rail
      from its inventory.
    - Useful for laying down tracks in new areas, ensuring a continuous path for the cart to follow.

#### Replace Mode
- **Function**: The `Replace` mode is designed to replace existing rails with new ones.
- **Usage**:
    - The Piston Cart will check if there is an existing rail at its current position.
    - If it finds a rail, it will remove the old rail and place a new one from its inventory.
    - Ideal for upgrading or repairing existing tracks without manually removing the old rails first.

:::info[tl;dr]
- **Place**: Adds new rails where none exist.
- **Replace**: Replaces existing rails with new ones.
  :::

Choose the appropriate mode based on whether you need to lay new tracks or upgrade existing ones. Understanding these
modes ensures efficient management of your rail system.
