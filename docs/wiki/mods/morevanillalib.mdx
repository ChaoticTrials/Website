## Abilities
### Auto Smelt
Tools with Auto Smelt modify drops by replacing them with their furnace-processed output. This applies to block drops
(e.g., Log -> Charcoal) and mob drops (e.g., Raw Beef -> Steak).

### Double Drop
The Double Drop feature allows specific ores to drop additional items when mined, depending on the tool's material. The
chance for extra drops is configurable, and tools without the Silk Touch enchantment can trigger this feature. Diamond,
Coal, Emerald, Lapis, Quartz, and Redstone ores have unique chances for Double Drops based on their respective
configuration settings, see [materials](#materials) above.

### Extra Damage
Extra Damage is applied to specific entities when using axes and swords based on the tool type:

| **Tool Type**  | **Affected Entities**         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Bone**       | Skeletons                     |
| **Ender**      | Endermen and Endermites       |
| **Fiery**      | Magma Cubes                   |
| **Prismarine** | Guardians                     |
| **Slime**      | Slimes, excluding Magma Cubes |

:::info
This effect applies to direct subclasses of the mentioned entities. If a mod uses the vanilla base class of these
entities, they will also be affected.
:::

The default chance is 20% per hit, configurable in the [server config](#server).

### Extra Drop
Tools have a material-based chance to drop their repair material on each use (e.g., hitting a mob or mining a block).

The default chance is 0.05% per use, configurable in the [server config](#server).

### Glowstone Drop
Glowstone blocks will always drop 4 Glowstone Dust.

### Head Drop
Defeating skeleton-type enemies may result in a rare drop of the enemy's head. This chance is influenced by the Fortune
enchantment on the tool.

The default chance is 5% per kill, configurable in the [server config](#server).

### Paper Damage
Using Paper tools introduces a chance for the player to inflict minor self-damage, humorously called a "paper cut". This
can occur during tasks such as using items, destroying blocks, or hitting entities.

The default chance is 10% per activity, configurable in the [server config](#server).

## Enchantments
The mod adds "Luck of Cheap Repairing," an enchantment that removes the repair cost in an anvil. This enchantment can be
applied to all breakable items.

## Config
### Common
You can choose whether only vanilla materials should be added. This setting affects only Vanilla Hammers and Vanilla
Excavators. If enabled, only vanilla materials will be used for these tools.

### Server
The server config file is located in the `serverconfig` directory within the world directory. Here, you can adjust most
values in the [materials table](#materials).
