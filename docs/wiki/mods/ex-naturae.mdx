### Compressed Variants
Each tool also has a compressed variant, which retains the same abilities but consumes 10 more mana per operation
(except for Terrasteel). These variants can additionally process compressed blocks.

## Compatibility
**Ex Naturae** is fully compatible with [Ex Compressum](https://modrinth.com/ex-compressum). When both mods are loaded,
compressed variants of the hammers and crooks become available, providing enhanced functionality for managing resources
and combat.
