# Dimensions
## Overworld
You can configure whether the Overworld should generate as in a normal world. This setting will disregard
configured [structures](structures.md#generating-structures) and [features](structures.md#generating-features). This is
especially useful when your [starting dimension](spawn.md#dimension) is not the Overworld.

## The Nether
You have the option to set the Nether to generate as in a normal world. Similar to the Overworld, this will ignore the
configured [structures](structures.md#generating-structures) and [features](structures.md#generating-features).

## The End
You can configure the End to generate as in a normal world, ignoring the
configured [structures](structures.md#generating-structures) and [features](structures.md#generating-features).
Additionally, you can decide whether the main island, which includes the Ender Dragon, should be generated or not.

## Other Dimensions
All other dimensions added by datapacks or mods will not be void and cannot be configured. For compatibility issues,
please contact the mod author
or [open an issue on GitHub ðŸ”—](https://github.com/ChaoticTrials/SkyblockBuilder/issues/new?assignees=MelanX&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=).
