# Invitations
## Inviting Users
Everyone in a team can invite other players. To do this, use the command `/skyblock invite <player>`, which will send an
invitation to the specified player. Note that only players who are not currently in a team can be invited.

## Accepting Invitations
Players who receive an invitation can accept it if they are not already part of a team. To accept an invitation, use the
command `/skyblock accept <team>`. Alternatively, you can decline an invitation with the command
`/skyblock decline <team>`.
